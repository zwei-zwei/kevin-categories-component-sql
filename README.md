# Categorization Component

> This component uses sorting criteria to create and render lists of videos. The three basic sorting criteria are: Recent broadcasts, Recent highlights & uploads, and Popular clips. The lists that the component renders are 1-1 with the sorting criteria, i.e., there will be one list for each sorting criterion.
